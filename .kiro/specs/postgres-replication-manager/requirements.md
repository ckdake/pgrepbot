# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PostgreSQL Replication Manager is a web-based tool designed to simplify the management of PostgreSQL logical replication across multiple cloud environments (AWS, GCP) and VPCs. The system will provide a centralized interface for monitoring replication topology, managing replication streams, and executing schema migrations across all replica endpoints. The tool will be deployable as a containerized service within AWS infrastructure and will integrate with existing AWS services like Secrets Manager, RDS Proxy, and SSM for secure connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to view the current replication topology in a visual interface, so that I can quickly understand the relationships between primary and replica databases across different cloud environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a visual topology map showing all configured databases and their replication relationships
2. WHEN displaying the topology THEN the system SHALL show database connection status (connected/disconnected) for each endpoint
3. WHEN displaying the topology THEN the system SHALL indicate the direction of replication flows between databases
4. WHEN a database is unreachable THEN the system SHALL visually highlight the affected nodes and connections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to monitor the status of logical replication streams, so that I can identify issues and track replication progress including initial backfill operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing replication status THEN the system SHALL display current replication lag for each subscription
2. WHEN a replication stream is performing initial backfill THEN the system SHALL show backfill progress percentage and estimated completion time
3. WHEN replication errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages and timestamps from PostgreSQL logs
4. WHEN checking subscription status THEN the system SHALL show publication and subscription details including table synchronization state
5. IF replication lag exceeds configurable thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight the affected streams with warning indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to create new logical replication streams through a web interface, so that I can set up replication without manually running scripts and managing multiple connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new replication stream THEN the system SHALL accept source database connection details and AWS Secrets Manager ARN for credentials
2. WHEN creating a new replication stream THEN the system SHALL accept target database connection details and credentials ARN
3. WHEN establishing replication THEN the system SHALL connect directly to databases within the VPC without requiring bastion hosts
4. WHEN creating replication THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity to both source and target databases before proceeding
5. WHEN replication setup completes THEN the system SHALL update the topology view to reflect the new replication stream
6. IF replication setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and rollback any partial configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to execute schema migrations across all replica endpoints through a web interface, so that I can maintain schema consistency without manually connecting to each database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating schema migration THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to upload or paste SQL migration scripts
2. WHEN executing migrations THEN the system SHALL run the migration on all configured replica endpoints (excluding primary databases)
3. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL execute migrations sequentially and report success/failure status for each endpoint
4. WHEN migration fails on any endpoint THEN the system SHALL halt execution and provide detailed error information
5. WHEN migrations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report showing results for each database endpoint
6. IF a migration is already running THEN the system SHALL prevent concurrent migration executions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to configure database endpoints and credentials through a configuration interface, so that I can manage my replication infrastructure without modifying code or configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a database endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept connection parameters including host, port, database name, and VPC/networking details
2. WHEN configuring credentials THEN the system SHALL accept AWS Secrets Manager ARNs and validate access to the secrets
3. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all connection details and credential access
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh topology and status displays to reflect changes
5. IF credential validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about IAM permissions or secret access issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the system to integrate with existing AWS infrastructure and security practices, so that I can deploy it securely within my VPC environment as the centralized database access point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL run as a containerized service (ECS or Lambda) within the specified VPC with direct database connectivity
2. WHEN accessing databases THEN the system SHALL use IAM authentication where configured
3. WHEN retrieving credentials THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS Secrets Manager using appropriate IAM roles
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL not log or store database credentials in plain text
5. WHEN connecting to databases THEN the system SHALL serve as the centralized access point eliminating the need for individual bastion host connections
6. IF IAM permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating required permissions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow modern Python development practices and maintain high code quality, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL use Python 3.13+ with modern type hints and async/await patterns
2. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic v2 for comprehensive data validation and serialization
3. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 80% test coverage with pytest and include both unit and integration tests
4. WHEN checking code quality THEN the system SHALL use Ruff for linting and formatting with line length of 120 characters
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL create optimized Docker containers separate from development environments
6. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support virtual environment setup with make commands for common tasks
7. IF code quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to receive alerts and notifications about replication issues, so that I can respond quickly to problems that could affect data consistency or availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replication lag exceeds configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alert notifications
2. WHEN replication streams fail or disconnect THEN the system SHALL immediately alert administrators
3. WHEN PostgreSQL log errors related to replication are detected THEN the system SHALL surface these errors in the interface
4. WHEN backfill operations stall or fail THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate alerts
5. IF the system cannot connect to a configured database THEN the system SHALL alert about connectivity issues
6. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL provide actionable information about the issue and potential resolution steps
